### In this project, a realtime movie list is gotten by angular.js. 


- In the 'package.json' file, I config the "npm run start" or "npm start" to install some packages in 'node_modules' and 'bower_components'.

- '.gitignore' used to ignore the packages when upload to github.

- '.editorconfig' used config the editor coding rules.

- '.gitattributes' used to config the file type, default as text file.
