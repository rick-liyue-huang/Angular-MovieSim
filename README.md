### In this project, a realtime movie list is gotten by angular.js, through douban WebAPI.

Here I create a project used to show the realtime movie list, including the movies in theaters, coming soon movies, and the movie top list.

Note that: 

- In the 'package.json' file, I config the "npm run start" or "npm start" to install some packages in 'node_modules' and 'bower_components'.

- '.gitignore' used to ignore the packages when upload to github.

- '.editorconfig' used config the editor coding rules.

- '.gitattributes' used to config the file type, default as text file.

- Because the douban.com webAPI DNS config problems, the pictures cannot show sometimes, but the other data can show anyway.

- to show project, please firstly run 'npm start' in terminal or cmd. 

- If run the 'npm start' in terminal or cmd the address should be 'http://localhost:8888', if it is 'http://localhost//localhost:8888', please change it.

- We also can run the project by start 'sublimeserver' plugin in sublime.


- We can add the plugin of "no referer image" to explore the pictures in chrome browsers
